    <sec>INTRO</sec>
    I hope the content of these short/long blog posts can be useful to someone. Posts mostly include application of data science, machine learning and 
    data visualization concepts in geotechnical engineering, with focus on geotechnical site assessment. Other topics can also show up. 
    Sometimes the code is included along the main text and sometimes it isn't. The work has been almost exclusively done with 
    <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" title="R WEBPAGE" target="_blank">R</a> code.</p>
