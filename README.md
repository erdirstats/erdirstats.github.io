<h2 style="color:#2F2F2F;">WELCOME ðŸ˜„</h2>

Here you can find some blog posts on geotechnics and I have written. It includes application of data science, machine learning and data visualization concepts in geotechnical engineering, with focus on geotechnical site assessment. <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">WordPress Homepage</a> The work has been almost exclusively done using [<font color="#2F2F2F">#rstats</font>](https://www.r-project.org/).
