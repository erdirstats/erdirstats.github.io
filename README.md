<h2 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 900;">WELCOME ðŸ˜„</h2>  

<p>I am using these pages to publish some long and/or short blog posts on geotechnics and I have written. These mostly include application of data science, machine learning and data visualization concepts in geotechnical engineering, with focus on geotechnical site assessment. Other topics can show up sometimes. The work has been almost exclusively done using <a style="color: #2F2F2F;" href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #2F2F2F; font-weight: 900;">#</span>rstats</a>. Sometimes the code is included in the article and sometimes it isn't.</p>

<blockquote style="font-style: normal;">Using machine learning (ML) to predict blowcounts needed for the installation of jacket piles, located in North Sea soil, using CPTU data. This was part of the Data Science Prediction Event created under the framework of the ISFOG2020 conference.</blockquote>

<blockquote style="font-style: normal;">The following is a short post on predicting small-strain stiffness properties from CPTU measurements by ensembling several machine learning (ML) models. More specifically, we are going to predict the value of the shear modulus at small strain, <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: 900; background-color: #F7F7F7">Gmax</span>.</blockquote>
