<sec>INTRO</sec>
<br>
Here I publish some long and/or short blog posts on geotechnics. This works very well for me as a way to document stuff but I also hope the content can be useful to other readers too. Posts mostly include application of data science, machine learning and data visualization concepts in geotechnical engineering, with focus on geotechnical site assessment. Other topics can also show up. Sometimes the code is included along the main text and sometimes it isn't. The work has been almost exclusively done with

 code.

<br>2022-03-15</p>
<blockquote>It can be useful sometimes to create an idea on how the <code>CPTU</code> measurement points of a particular site or soil unit are distributed among different <code>SBT</code> (Soil Behavior Type) zones. I wrote a small function to categorize <code>CPTU</code> data points according to the zone they plot in a few <code>SBT</code> charts.</blockquote>

<br>2021-04-26</p>
<blockquote>Short post on predicting small-strain stiffness properties from <code>CPTU</code> measurements by ensembling several machine learning models. More specifically, we are going to predict the value of the shear modulus at small strain, <code>Gmax</code>.</blockquote>

<br>2021-03-21</p>
<blockquote>Small app for dealing with down-hole <code>CPTU</code> measurements. The basic idea of the app is to remove initial measurement points (“fake measurements”) within each down-hole <code>CPTU</code> stroke, which may not be representative of the real soil conditions.</blockquote>

<br>2020-01-08</p>
<blockquote>Building some machine learning models to predict blowcounts needed for the installation of jacket piles, located in North Sea soil, using <code>CPTU</code> data. This was part of the Data Science Prediction Event created under the framework of the ISFOG2020 conference.</blockquote>
