This post includes a <b>comprehensive summary</b> of the process we went through to build a machine learning (ML) model for the Data Science Prediction Event created under the framework of the ISFOG2020 conference. The competition was hosted in Kaggle and run through a period of eight months, from April to December 2019. The problem proposed for the prediction event is to use CPTu data to predict blowcounts needed for the installation of jacket piles, located in North Sea soil.
