<p>Here you can find some blog posts on geotechnics and I have written. It includes application of data science, machine learning and data visualization concepts in geotechnical engineering, with focus on geotechnical site assessment. The work has been almost exclusively done using <a style="color: #2F2F2F; font-weight: 900;" href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">#rstats</a></p>

<blockquote>The following is a short post on predicting small-strain stiffness properties from CPTU measurements by ensembling several machine learning (ML) models. More specifically, we are going to predict the value of the shear modulus at small strain, `Gmax`.</blockquote>
